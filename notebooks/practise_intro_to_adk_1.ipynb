    "- An `Agent` in Google ADK orchestrates the interaction between the user, the LLM, and the available tools\n",

    "- you configure it with several key parameters:\n",
    "    * `name`: A unique identifier for this agent (e.g., \"friendly_cypher_agent\\_v1\").  \n",
    "    * `model`: Specifies which LLM to use. you'll use the `llm` variable we defined above.  \n",
    "    * `description`: A summary of the agent's overall purpose. This is like public documentation that helps other agents decide when to delegate tasks to *this* agent.  \n",
    "    * `instruction`: Detailed guidance given to the LLM on how this agent should behave, its persona, goals, and specifically *how and when* to utilize its assigned `tools`.  \n",
    "    * `tools`: A list containing the actual Python tool functions the agent is allowed to use (e.g., `[say_hello]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:** \n",
    "- Provide clear and specific `instruction` prompts. The more detailed the instructions, the better the LLM can understand its role and how to use its tools effectively. Be explicit about error handling if needed.\n",
    "- Choose descriptive `name` and `description` values. These are used internally by ADK and are vital for features like automatic delegation (covered later)."

The Runner receives the event, records state changes, updates memory and forwards the event to the user interface.
